# Customer purchase behaviour during black friday sale at Walmart.

Buisness Problem :

An American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of supercenters, discount departmental stores, and grocery stores from the United States. Retail Corporation 
has more than 100 million customers worldwide. The Management team at Retail Corporation wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against 
the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female
customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Let us assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million are female).


Following questions were answered during the analysis:

1. Checking the number of unique product_ids which were purchased during Black Friday sale
2. Which user made the highest purchase
3. Which age group does more shopping.
4. Which Gender tends to shop more on Black Friday sale.
5. Which marital status tends to do more shopping.
6. How much is being spent by a particular age group
7. Are women spending more money than men.
8. Checking which age group in females tends to purchase more.
9. Averages of mean of samples were calculated for men and women and the population mean were inferred using Central Limit Theorm to find out whether the women spend more or men.
10. Similar kind of activity was performed on Marital status and age-group.


Buisness Insights :

1. Since, maximum number of purchases were made in the age bracket of 26- 35, so we may assume that they may be drawing a handsome salary with least responsibility.
2. Least purchases, were made in the group of 0 - 17, we may assume that they may be dependent on some other source for finances.
3. Number of males who purchased during the sale is approximately 2.5 times more than females, we may assume that Males tend to purchase more during festive sale or dependent
   females may be using the males account or credit card for the purchase.
4. Age groups making purchases follows a guassian distribution. We can see that minimum number of purchases were made by age group of 0 - 17 followed by  18 - 25 and then maximum
   sales by 26 - 35 . After this the curve has started declining towards the age group of 36 - 45 which is followed by 46 - 50, 51 - 55 and 55+.
5. Most of the people doing shopping are from city B, we may assume that city B may be metropolitan city where people are earning more than city c and  city a and hence more
   spending.
7. People with occupation with mask 4 are the ones who are purchasing more, we may assume that they are from highest earning brackets and people with occupation mask 3 is least
   purchasing during the sale, we may assume that they are from lowest earning bracket.
8. We can see that minimum amount spent by a female and male is same.
9. There is not much diffrence in maximum amount spent by a female and male.
10. There is a huge diffrence in count and sum of purchases which indicates that males tend to purchase more in black friday sale.
11. We can assume  the mean of entire female population  8734.94 because mean of averages of samples for females are 8734.94.
12. We can assume  the mean of entire male population  9437.15 because mean of averges of sample for males are 9437.15.
13. We can see that mean of entire female population is 8734.94 while for male population the mean is 9437.15. we can say that males are spending more than females .
14. Mean of married population is : 9261.43 and for unmarried population is 9265.65.
15. Mean value for the age-group of 0-17 for entire population may be assumed as 8932.05.
16. Mean value for the age-group of 18-25 for entire population may be assumed as 9169.63.
17. Mean value for the age-group of 26-35 for entire population may be assumed as 9253.15.
18. Mean value for the age-group of 36-45 for entire population may be assumed as 9331.0044.
19. Mean value for the age-group of 46 - 50 for entire population may be assumed as 9208.19.
20. Mean value for the age-group of 50 - 55 for entire population may be assumed as 9534.23.
21. Mean value for the age-group of 55+ for entire population may be assumed as 9334.96.


Recommendations:

1. Walmart shall open more retail stores in city B.
2. Walmart shall give some attractive discount to married people , so that they can also purchase more.
3. Since, most of the people purchasing in sale are from occupation mask 4 , we may assume the following that either the occupation from mask 4 may be in finance , technology or
   investment banking. If this assumption is correct, walmart shall give discount on the products which arebuseful for their professional lives as well such as technology gagdets.
4. By looking at the statistical figure or mean purchase of females and males, females are purchasing less than the males. Walmart shall plan a strategy to attract female
   customers and their beauty products.
